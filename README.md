simple client-server communication using TCP sockets. The server listens on a specified port for incoming connections, while the client connects to the server and communicates by sending and receiving messages.




## Usage

Compile the server:

```bash
  gcc server.c -o server
```

Compile the client:

```bash
  gcc client.c -o client
```    

Run the server:

```bash
  ./server 127.0.0.1
```   
Run the client:

```bash
  ./client 127.0.0.1
``` 
### Message first by client
